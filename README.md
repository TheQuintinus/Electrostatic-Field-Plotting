## Overview

This project implements a numerical and analytical model of the electric field generated by a finite-length coaxial cylindrical structure with a dielectric layer, together with a 3D visualization pipeline using PyVista.

The work combines:
- Electromagnetic theory
- Numerical discretization
- Vectorized scientific computing (NumPy)
- 3D scientific visualization (PyVista)

It is intended as an educational and research-oriented tool, demonstrating both physical modeling and clean, modular Python design.

## Physical Problem Description

The system modeled consists of:

- An inner conductor at fixed potential
- A dielectric layer surrounding the inner conductor
- An outer grounded conductor
- A finite cylinder length, introducing edge effects

Unlike the ideal infinite coaxial cable, the finite length causes:

- Axial electric field components
- Deviations from the purely radial analytical solution

In the ideal infinite-length case, the purely radial electric field is obtained
from Laplace’s equation in cylindrical coordinates, assuming radial dependence
only. The electric field in the finite system is computed by superposition of
finite line charge contributions and corrected inside the dielectric region using
permittivity ratios.

## Project Structure
```
.
├── cylinder.py
├── field.py
├── plot.py
├── main.py
```

- `cylinder.py` contains the geometric description and coordinate discretization
  of the coaxial system, independent of any physical model.
- `field.py` implements the electric field computation and physical logic,
  using the geometry provided by the cylindrical grid.
- `plot.py` handles visualization and rendering of the electric field using
  PyVista, without embedding physical assumptions.
- `main.py` serves as the entry point, connecting the physical model to the
  visualization layer.

This separation between geometry, physical modeling, and visualization improves
clarity, reusability, and extensibility of the code.

## Author

This project emerges from the study of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) case and was developed as part of a learning effort in applied physics and numerical modeling, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and extensibility
